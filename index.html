                <p>I am an experienced computer programmer.  In the past I programmed in legacy code, before spending 8.5 years taking care 
                    of 2 elderly parents. I have aasociate and professional Jave certifications and knowledge of Spring and am working on AWS certification. In the distant 
                    past I obtained a PhD from Notre Dame, and earned a perfect score on my GRE analytical section. I consider myself 
                    an optimtizer and a very good finisher once I become involved in a task. I also failed kindergarten 
                    last year! Beginning Vietnamese involves sounds not made in English and is most challenging.
