## Project Goals
In summary this repo will use gitHub, establish a portfolio including photo, links, media queries, flexbox and CSS-variables.  
==============================================================================================================================   
Github:  
    Create Repo  
    Clone to local machine   
    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  
    Copy sample files from prior project (or create from scratch)   
    -- Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzipping likely fastest method.     
    -- Could not find a quicker way to copy over all files.    
    ... create HTML and CSS ...  
    Commit and push files back to gitHub  
    Deploy code  
    Make Sure it Works  
  
HTML:   
    View the Acceptance Criteria. 
    Create/Modify HTML and CSS.   
  
    (aa) follows accessibility standards - alts, better names for html tags, made sure language set.
    (bb) responsive layout - flexbox, media queries, CSS-variables.
    (a) presented with the developer's name,a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    (b) click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    (c) click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    (d) presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    (e) click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    (f) resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
